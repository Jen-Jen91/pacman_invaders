# Pacman Invaders
This 2D shooter game was created as part of a hackathon project over 6 weeks. The brief was to create something that was based on PacMan and as part of a small group, we decided to create a mash-up of Pacman and Space Invaders.

#### Features of the game:
- User can move PacMan left and right.
- User can fire pills at the ghosts by hitting spacebar.
- Ghosts move right and left, moving down the screen when they hit a wall.
- If all ghosts are destroyed, game moves onto the next level.
- Ghosts will move faster as the levels increase.
- PacMan loses a life when hit by a pill.
- Player earns points when destroying ghosts
- Ghosts randomly fire pills down the screen towards PacMan.
- Barriers protect PacMan from the pills fired by the ghosts.
- Barriers will slowly degrade, reducing their size when hit by pills, both fired from the ghosts and from PacMan.
- Ghosts randomly drop fruit which have specific bonuses, including extra points, invincibility, barrier restoration, and extra life.


#### Play the game:
- To play the game, clone this repo and open "Standalone Build".
