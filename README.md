# pacman_invaders_unity
This was a 'pacathon' project I worked on with two friends over 6 weeks. The brief was to create something that was based on PacMan, suggestions included what PacMan would be like when mixed with the game Snake, or if they lived in an augmented reality.

My friends and I went through some classic arcade games to see if we could find one that would fit well with PacMan, and come up with some ideas as to how we could mix the two.
We came up with Space Invaders, Pong and Frogger. We mapped out ideas for each mash-up, and found that we could do a lot more creative things with Space Invaders.

We spent 6 weeks working on this game, sometimes working together in a group and sometimes dividing up tasks to work individually.

- Barriers protect PacMan from the pills fired by the ghosts.
